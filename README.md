NPM is used for front end package management. 

1. Install Node. I recommend using Node Version Manager https://github.com/creationix/nvm so that you can hook into the `.nvmrc` file for automated Node version management goodness. 
2. Clone repo and install Node modules: `npm install`.
3. Start browser using npm start script: `npm run start-static`.
